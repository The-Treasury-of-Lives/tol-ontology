<h1>About gist</h1>

<p>gist is Semantic Arts' minimalist upper ontology for the enterprise. It is designed to have the maximum coverage of typical business ontology concepts with the fewest number of primitives and the least amount of ambiguity.</p>

<p>We maintain an active gist community forum where developers and users of gist come together to discuss the gist model, implementation best practices, and the evolution of gist. Meetings occur virtually on the first Thursday of every other month, starting in January. Please send email to <a href="mailto:GistForum@semanticarts.com">GistForum@semanticarts.com</a> if you would like to become involved.</p>

<p>You can also contribute to gist by adding your comments to <a href="https://github.com/semanticarts/gist/issues">issue discussion threads</a> and submitting new issues and pull requests (see <a href="https://github.com/semanticarts/gist/blob/master/docs/Contributing.md">guidelines for contributions</a>). You can view <a href="https://github.com/semanticarts/gist/wiki/gist-Development-Team-Meeting-Notes">minutes</a> from our bi-monthly review sessions to find out what we've been discussing and get a preview of upcoming changes to gist.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>gist Constellations (visualizations)</strong>
<ul>
<li>A collection of PNG images built using the <a href="http://semantechs.co.uk/turtle-editor-viewer/">Turtle Editor Viewer</a>.
