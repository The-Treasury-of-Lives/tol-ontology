<h1>New Magnitudes and Units of Measure in gist 13</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The following is an informal high-level description of changes to gist to better support magnitudes and units of measure.</p>

<p>With gist 13, the ontology for magnitudes and units of measure has been revisited to provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simpler governance</li>
<li>Support for financial metrics</li>
<li>Simple standard ways to represent data involving units of measure</li>
<li>Support for calculations involving units of measure</li>
</ul>

<p>The release includes scripts for converting data from gist 12 to gist 13, and Semantic Arts will also provide a rich set of reference data for units of measure that can be tapped going forward.</p>

<h2>Simple example</h2>

<p>To see how gist 13 accomplishes these goals, let’s start with a simple example and build on it.</p>

<p>A patio has an area of 144 square feet.</p>

<p>We can break this statement down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The patio has a magnitude that represents its area</li>
<li>The magnitude is for an area (a measurable characteristic, also called an aspect)</li>
<li>The magnitude uses square feet to measure the area</li>
<li>The magnitude has a numeric value of 144</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these simpler statements can be represented as a triple; the gist properties involved are, respectively:</p>

<ul>
<li>has magnitude</li>
<li>has aspect (new)</li>
<li>has unit of measure</li>
<li>numeric value</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main concepts</h2>

<p>Building on this example, the new concepts for units of measure in gist 13 are:</p>

<ul>
<li>every magnitude is directly related to a measurable characteristic (called an aspect)</li>
<li>aspects and units of measure are treated as reference data and are not part of the ontology</li>
<li>groups of units can be established, where all the units in the group measure the same aspect (for example foot, meter and kilometer all measure distance)</li>
<li>the units of measure in a group are all multiples of the same product of powers of base units, given as exponent of kilogram, exponent of meter, exponent of second, etc.</li>
<li>as before, every unit of measure has a conversion factor and a conversion offset that can be used to convert from one unit of measure to another (e.g. from liters to gallons)</li>
<li>there is a simple way to represent units of measure and aspects in terms of component parts, e.g. ‘profit = revenue – expenses’ or ‘watt hour per mile = watt x hour / mile’</li>
<li>aspects can be categorized by discipline</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's new and different</h2>

<p>To draw a comparison with gist 12:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is no longer necessary to change the ontology to add new aspects and units of measure, because they are treated as reference data instead of as classes</li>
<li>it is no longer necessary to figure out if a unit is a coherent unit, a simple unit, a product unit, etc.</li>
<li>because of the two items above, gist now has 25% fewer classes</li>
<li>there is now one standard way to represent magnitudes and aspects</li>
<li>there is now a simple way to validate that a unit of measure is applicable for measuring a given aspect (i.e. the unit of measure belongs to a unit group related to the aspect)</li>
<li>calculations can now be done in SPARQL that would be far more complex in gist 12</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship to the International System of Units</h2>

<p>Most units of measure can be related to the International System of Units as in the following example using base units kilogram, meter, and second:</p>

<p>1 watt-hour = 3600 x kilogram meter squared per second squared</p>

<p>In terms of the ontology:</p>

<ul>
<li>the conversion factor for watt-hour is 3600</li>
<li>the exponent of kilogram is 1</li>
<li>the exponent of meter is 2</li>
<li>the exponent of second is -2</li>
<li>all other exponents are zero</li>
</ul>

<p>Every member of a unit group containing watt-hour must be a multiple of kilogram meter squared per second squared.</p>

<h2>Working with exponents</h2>

<p>Calculations involving the exponents can be done as follows:</p>

<p>2 meters squared x 3 meters
= 2 x 3 (meter with exponent 2) x (meter with exponent 1)
= 6 meter with exponent 3    [to get the product, add the exponents]</p>

<p>Calculations involving exponents can be done in SPARQL queries. A more complex example is:
1 watt = 1 kilogram meter squared per second cubed
1 hour = 3600 seconds
1 mile = 1609.34 meters</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<p>1 watt-hour per mile
= 1 x watt x hour x mile^-1
= (1 x kilogram x meter^2 x second^-3) x (3600 x second) x (1609.344 meter)^-1
= (1 x 3600 x 1609.344^-1)  x kilogram x (meter^2 x meter^-1) x (second^-3 x second)
= 2.237 x kilogram x meter x second^-2</p>

<p>This calculation relates the unit ‘watt-hour per mile’ to the base units kilogram, meter, and second of the International System of Units, with a conversionFactor of 2.237.</p>
