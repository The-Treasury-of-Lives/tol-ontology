# README

This directory contains both taxonomies (in the tolx namespace) and controlled instance data (in the told namespace). The distinction rests primarily on whether the instances are categories which typically have only semantic relationships, such as broader/narrower, to one another, vs instance data which has other relationships - e.g., a tradition is founded by a person, etc.
