693,Derge,sde dge rgyal rigs,སྡེ་དགེ་རྒྱལ་རིགས།,Ruler,R44,"<p>The Derge lineage is said to stem from the Gar clan through Gar Tongtsen Yulzung, a minister of the Tibetan emperor <a href=""/biographies/view/Songtsen-Gampo/TBRC_p8067"">Songtsen Gampo</a>. His great-grandson Lhaje Jampai Pel moved from central Tibet to Khams in the early ninth century, settling his family in Ling. Likely originally patrons of the Bon, in the twenty-third generation the family first established a connection with the Sakya hierarchy, when the patriarch Zhonnu Dorje studied under <a href=""/biographies/view/Sakya-Paṇḍita/TBRC_p1056"">Sakya Paṇḍita</a>. His grandson, Sonam Rinchen, served <a href=""/biographies/view/Pakpa/TBRC_p1048"">Pakpa</a> as an attendant and received a Yuan commission for Samar, to the south of present-day Derge. Pakpa called the site a place of &quot;four accomplishments and ten virtues&quot; (<em>sde bzhi dge bcu</em>), a phrase that was shortened to <em>sde dge</em> and adopted by the family.

According to Tibetan tradition, Ga Yeshe Dargye, from whom Changtul and his heirs claim descent, was dispatched by <a href=""/biographies/view/King-Relpachen/TBRC_P2MS13218"">King Relpachen</a> from central Tibet to the areas around present-day Ngawa, Zungchu and Dzoge with an army of ten-thousand men.
