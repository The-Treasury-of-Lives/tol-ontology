Gyeltsen Pelzang also founded the first monastic complex of this tradition there,&nbsp;<a href=""https://treasuryoflives.org/geographies/view/Dondrubding-Monastery/TBRC_G512"">Dondrubding Monastery</a>, which served as the seat of his incarnation line, the Barawa Tulku. The Barawa tradition emerged from the Yanggon Kagyu, founded by&nbsp;<a href=""https://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Yanggonpa-Gyeltsen-Pel/TBRC_P5262"">Yanggonpa Gyeltsen Pel</a>. The latter is in turn a sub-branch of the Upper Druk. As early as the fourteenth century, the Barawa Kagyu spread to Bhutan. Later monasteries were established at different places in Tibet but mainly along the Himalayan slopes and in Sikkim. The most important centers in Tibet were Dondrubding Monastery in Baradrak, Drapu Choling Monastery in Kyirong, and Kagyu Gonsar Monastery in the Chumbi Valley, none of which have survived into the modern era, although the tradition continues in exile communities. The core teachings include, among others, the Mountain Dharma Trilogy (<em>ri chos skor gsum</em>) by Yanggonpa Gyeltsen Pel and the Exegesis of Buddhism (<em>thar par 'jug pa'i gru bo zab don chos kyi gter mdzod</em>), an encyclopedia of Buddhist scholasticism by Barawa Gyeltsen Pelzang.</p> <p> Ehrhard, Franz-Karl. 2009.

Bodong,TOL611,T2054,bo dong,,Q890024,,Bodong Panchen Chokle Namgyel,TOLP4344,P2627,"<p> The Bodong (bo dong) tradition has a long and complicated history. The seat of what would become the institutionally independent Bodong lineage was the monastery Bodong E, which was founded in 1049 by Geshe Mudrapa Chenpo. What teachings were current there is difficult to know, save that in the twelfth century <a href=""/biographies/view/Kodrakpa-Sonam-Gyeltsen/P1514"">Kodrakpa Sonam Gyeltsen</a> invited the Nepali yogin <a href=""/biographies/view/name/P3276"">Vibhūticandra</a> to Tibet and received from him a new transmission of the six-branch practice of the Kālacakra. Kodrakpa also propagated a lineage of Lamdre which was later subsumed into the Sakya tradition by <a href=""/biographies/view/Sonam-Gyeltsen/P1226"">Sonam Gyeltsen</a> and <a href=""/biographies/view/Ngorchen-Kunga-Zangpo/P1132"">Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo</a>. Its greatest representative was <a href=""/biographies/view/Bodong-Pa?chen-Chokle-Namgyel/P2627"">Bodong Paṇchen Chokle Namgyel</a>, with whom the unique Bodong Tradition is commonly said to have begun. It is important to avoid confusing Bodong Panchen with <a href=""/biographies/view/Jonang-Chokle-Namgyel/P152"">Jonang Chokle Namgyel</a>, a teacher of <a href=""/biographies/view/Tsongkhapa/TBRC_p64"">Tsongkhapa</a> and proponent of the <em>Zhentong</em> view.</p>",
Bon,TOL240,T247,bon,苯,Q815628,,Tonpa Shenrab,TOLP13800,P2MS13220,"<p> Bon (bon) is often said to be the indigenous religion of the Himalayan region, preserving beliefs and practices that predate the introduction of Buddhism. The Bon teachings are said to have originally come from a land known as Tazik, introduced to human beings by the enlightened being Tonpa Shenrab, and flourished in the kingdom of Zhangzhung on the western Tibetan Plateau. During the Tibetan Empire, when Buddhism was adopted in Tibet, native priests lost their status, and their practices, some of which were later absorbed into some Tibetan Buddhist traditions, were suppressed. In the centuries following, the surviving adherents to the tradition organized monastic centers, and Bon revealed scriptures were produced that integrated altered versions of many of the ideas and practices brought to Tibet by the Buddhists, resulting in a tradition known as ""New Bon."" There remains today a pernicious prejudice against Bon in Tibet, and a tenacious belief that Bon is merely a form of Buddhism.</p>",

One of the largest and most influential Kagyu sub-traditions, it briefly vied with the Sakya for control of Tibet during the thirteenth century.

The tradition draws its name from a vision Tsangpa Gyare had of nine dragons – <em>druk</em> in Tibetan. The principal seat is at <a href=""/geographies/view/Ralung/TBRC_G3582"">Ralung</a>, in Tibet, the seat of the <a href=""/incarnation/view/Gyelwang-Drukchen/TBRC_R8LS12812"">Gyelwang Drukchen</a>, head of the Tibetan branch of the tradition, which is made up of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Druk, following the transmission lines of three of Tsangpa Gyare's disciple: <a href=""/biographies/view/Gotsangpa/TBRC_P2090"">Gotsangpa</a>, <a href=""/biographies/view/Wonre-Darma-Senggye/TBRC_P012"">Wonre Darma Senggye</a>, and <a href=""/biographies/view/Lorepa/TBRC_P4252"">Lorepa</a>, respectively.

Geluk,TOL8,T819,dge lugs,格鲁派,Q319218,,Tsongkhapa Lobzang Drakpa,TOLP8986,P64,"<p> The Geluk (<em>dge lugs</em>) tradition follows the teachings of the fifteenth-century scholar monk <a href=""/biographies/view/Tsongkhapa-Lobzang-Drakpa/TBRC_p64"">Tsongkhapa Lobzang Drakpa</a>. Like the Kadam tradition which the Geluk absorbed and supplanted, the Geluk place an emphasis on monastic discipline and scholarship, central to which is the their understanding and explication of the Mādhyamaka Prāsaṅgika philosophical position. They also maintain a strong, if somewhat less public, tradition of tantric transmission, scholarship, and practice. Followers of the Geluk tradition practice an extensive system of <em>Lamrim </em> and <em>Lojong</em>, both of which have their origins with <a href=""/biographies/view/Atisha/TBRC_p3379"">Atisha</a> and the Kadampa tradition. The Geluk also maintain a lineage of Mahāmudrā teachings. The primary tantric teachings studied and practiced in the Geluk are the tantric cycles of Yamāntaka, Cakrasaṃvara, and Guhyasamāja. The Kālacakra Tantra is also commonly practiced among many Geluk practitioners, as is the tantra of Vajrayoginī. The Geluk tradition became the dominant religious order in Tibet in the seventeenth century when the <a href=""/biographies/view/Fifth-Dalai-Lama/TBRC_p37"">Fifth Dalai Lama</a>, with the aid of the recently converted Mongols, orchestrated a defeat of the Kagyu king of Tsang and set himself up as political leader of Tibet. Since that time the Dalai Lamas' seat of government, the Ganden Podrang, has been the nominal seat of political power in Tibet, even if for most of the last four hundred years real power shifted among a number of players.</p>",
Jonang,TOL88,T360,jo nang,觉囊派,Q1702893,,Dolpopa Sherab Gyeltsen,TOLP2670,P139,"<p> The Jonang (<em>jo nang</em>) tradition was founded by <a href=""/biographies/view/Dolpopa-Sherab-Gyeltsen/TBRC_p139"">Dolpopa Sherab Gyeltsen</a>, who ascended to the throne of <a href=""/geographies/view/Jonang-Monastery/TBRC_g201"">Jonang Monastery</a> in 1326. Trained in the Sakya tradition, Dolpopa’s controversial teachings, especially his emphasis on the view known as <em>Zhentong (gzhan stong)</em> or <em>emptiness of other</em>, and the institutional independence of Jonang monastery, established the Jonang tradition apart as an independent tradition, although many members of the Sakya tradition continue to consider Jonang to be a subsect of that tradition. Dolpopa, like his predecessors at Jonang, particularly emphasized the teachings of the <em>Kālacakra Tantra</em> and its completion-stage practices known as the six-branch yoga, while also transmitting many other systems of Vajrayāna and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Following the death of the great Jonang scholar <a href=""/biographies/view/Tāranātha/TBRC_p1428"">Tāranātha</a>, the Jonang tradition was suppressed in the seventeenth century by the <a href=""/biographies/view/Fifth-Dalai-Lama/TBRC_p37"">Fifth Dalai Lama</a>; its monasteries were converted to the Geluk tradition and the teachings banned. The tradition has survived in the Dzamtang region of Amdo.</p>",
Kadam,TOL61,T791,bka' gdams pa,噶当派,Q588362,,Dromton Gyelwa Jungne,TOLP4267,P2557,"<p> The Kadam (<em>bka’ dam</em>) tradition was the first of the so-called New Schools of Tibetan Buddhism, traditions that arose during the Second Propagation of Buddhism in Tibet in the tenth century. The Kadam tradition began with <a href=""/biographies/view/Dromtonpa-Gyalwai-Jungne/TBRC_p2557"">Dromton Gyelwai Jungne</a>, a disciple of the Bengali teacher <a href=""/biographies/view/Atisha-Dīpaṃkara/TBRC_p3379"">Atiśa Dīpaṃkara</a>, who had been invited to Tibet by the kings of Purang in western Tibet to revitalize monastic Buddhism there. Dromton founded the monastery of <a href=""/geographies/view/Reting/TBRC_g74"">Reting</a> and propagated the <em>Lamrim</em> and <em>Lojong</em> teachings, which lay out a complete path to Buddhahood and means of training the mind, respectively. The Kadam teachers were known for their monastic discipline, a character that was adopted by the Geluk tradition that supplanted it in the fourteenth century, adopting its teaching and absorbing its monasteries.</p>",
Kalācakra,TOL73,T74,dus 'khor,十相自在,Q831837,,,,,"<p> There are two lineage of the Kālacakra, the Ra lineage (<em>rva lugs</em>) and the Dro lineage (<em>bro lugs</em>). The Dro lineage was established in Tibet by a Kashmiri disciple of Nalendrapa named Paṇḍita Somanatha, who traveled to Tibet in 1027, and his translator&nbsp;<a href=""/biographies/view/Dro-Lotsāwa-Sherab-Drak/TBRC_P2553"">Dro Lotsāwa Sherab Drak</a>, from which it takes its name. The Ra lineage was brought to Tibet by another Kashmiri disciple of Nalendrapa named Samantaśrībhadra, and translated by&nbsp;<a href=""/biographies/view/Ra-Lotsāwa-Chorab/TBRC_P3146"">Ra Lotsāwa Chorab</a>. These two lineages were absorbed by the dominant religious traditions of Tibet, particularly the Sakya and Geluk, but their transmission can not be said to be tied to any one of those traditions, and some historical figures are best understood as Kālacakra masters above any other affiliation they might have enjoyed.</p>",

Marpa’s disciple <a href=""/biographies/view/Milarepa/TBRC_p1853"">Milarepa</a> famously attained enlightenment in the caves of southern Tibet after renouncing a life of violent revenge; his disciple <a href=""/biographies/view/Gampopa/TBRC_p1844"">Gampopa</a> merged the lay siddha practice of his master with the Kadampa monasticism and scholarship that he had previously studied. Gampopa founded the first Kagyu monastery, <a href=""/geographies/view/Daklha-Gampo/TBRC_G197"">Daklha Gampo</a> in southern Tibet.

In addition to the above system, the Ngok (<em>rngog</em>) lineage begun by <a href=""/biographies/view/Ngok-Choku-Dorje/TBRC_P5514"">Ngok Choku Dorje</a>, a disciple of Marpa, was a distinct Marpa Kagyu tradition that existed independently for several centuries. Also often considered an independent tradition was the Rechung Nyengyu (<em>ras chung snyan brgyud</em>), initiated by the disciples of&nbsp; Milarepa’s disciple <a href=""/biographies/view/Rechung-Dorje-Drakpa/TBRC_P4278"">Rechung Dorje Drakpa</a>. The <a href=""https://treasuryoflives.org/tradition/Barawa-Kagyu"">Barawa Kagyu</a> tradition is considered a sub-branch of the Yanggon Kagyu, itself an offshoot of the Upper Drukpa. All Marpa Kagyu traditions claim allegiance to the tantric teachings of the Indian Mahāsiddha tradition, primarily that of Nāropa, in the form of the <em>Six Doctrines of Nā</em><em>ropa</em> (<em>nA</em>&nbsp; <em>ro chos drug</em>) and the doctrine of Mahāmudrā. The Kagyu were also heavily involved in the transmission of the Cakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, among other tantras of the Second Propagation era.</p>",See also T807 -- ask Elie if these are duplicates

Nyingma,TOL5,T1082,rnying ma,宁玛派,Q848771,,,,,"<p> The Nyingma (<em>rnying ma</em>) - literally the ""ancient"" - is considered the oldest tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, although when the disparate institutions and strands of transmission were first conceived as belonging to a singular and coherent entity is not clear. According to legend, the Nyingma teachings were brought to Tibet in the eighth century by <a href=""/biographies/view/Padmasambhava/TBRC_P4956"">Padmasambhava</a>, a tantric ritual specialist invited to Tibet to subjugate native deities that were obstructing the dissemination of Buddhism. Padmasambhava and other Indian masters such as <a href=""/biographies/view/Vimalamitra/TBRC_p7325"">Vimalamitra</a>, and select Tibetan translators such as <a href=""/biographies/view/Vairocana/TBRC_P5013"">Vairocana</a>, propagated the tradition's primary teaching, Dzogchen, a tantric system that has also been adopted to varying degree by other traditions. The Indic scriptures that were translated in the eighth and ninth centuries and the teachings by the masters of that era have come to be known as the ""Kama,"" or spoken word tradition. Since at least the twelfth century Nyingma teachers known as terton, or ""treasure revealers"" have produced new scriptures said to have been concealed by Padmasambhava or others for the benefit of future eras. The Nyingma maintains both lay and monastic traditions, with six mother monasteries: <a href=""/geographies/view/Dorje-Drak/TBRC_g11"">Dorje Drak</a> and <a href=""/geographies/view/Mindroling/TBRC_g14"">Mindroling</a> in central Tibet, and <a href=""/geographies/view/Katok/TBRC_g17"">Katok</a>, <a href=""/geographies/view/Pelyul/TBRC_g18"">Pelyul</a>, <a href=""/geographies/view/Dzogchen/TBRC_g16"">Dzogchen</a> and <a href=""/geographies/view/Zhechen/TBRC_g20"">Zhechen</a> in Kham.</p>",
