	According to some sources, the Takpu incarnation line is said to begin with Gushri Pelden Dondrub, who was born in the late fourteenth century. An alternate listing traces the first Takpu to the eighteenth century <a href=""/biographies/view/Lobzang-Tenpai-Gyeltsen/TBRC_P336"">Lobzang Tenpai Gyeltsen</a>. Another title commonly associated with the Takpu incarnations was that of Garwang: Gargyi Wangchuk and Gargyi Wangpo, already used by Lobzang Chokyi Wangchuk, who appears to have been known by this name.</p>
<p>
	<a href=""/biographies/view/Jampel-Tenpai-Ngodrub/TBRC_P231"">Jampel Tenpai Ngodrub</a> notes that he is the Fourth Gargyi Wangchuk. It seems that either an incarnation is missing from the accepted sequence, or that Tenpai Ngodrub counts Lobzang Tenpai Gyeltsen and not Chokyi Wangchuk as the first &lsquo;official&rsquo; Garwang incarnation. The latter explanation would follow today&rsquo;s usual presentation of the lineage as Tenpai Ngodrub appears to be regarded as the Fourth Takpu incarnation amongst contemporary Geluk lineage holders. Takpu incarnations are said to have been highly accomplished yogis and are well-known for their pure visions of deities and the ability to travel to various pure lands in order to receive teachings.</p>

After the death of the <a href=""/biographies/view/Third-Tongkhor,-Gyelwa-Gyatso/TBRC_P1004"">Third Tongkhor, Gyelwa Gyatso</a>, the line established two seats. According to tradition, a recently deceased seventeen-year old boy of mixed Tibetan and Chinese heritage, while being carried to his funeral, suddenly sat up and declared that he was the Tongkhor lama. Thought to be a zombie, the Chinese army was called in to destroy him. The boy emerged from the assault unharmed, convincing everyone that he was indeed the reincarnation of Gyelwa Gyatso. The identity of the young man, who was given the name <a href=""/biographies/view/Dogyu-Gyatso-/TBRC_P722"">Dogyu Gyatso </a>by local lamas, was later affirmed and taught by the Fourth Panchen Lama, <a href=""/biographies/view/Lobzang-Chokyi-Gyeltsen/TBRC_P719"">Lobzang Chokyi Gyeltsen</a>, and the Fifth Dalai Lama, <a href=""/biographies/view/Ngawang-Lobzang-Gyatso/TBRC_P37"">Ngawang Lobzang Gyatso</a>.
