900,G1KR841,Shide Dratsang,"<p>
	Shide Monastery was Reting Rinpoche&#39;s Lhasa residence, and the Shide-Reting complex was as large as the Barkhor in size. Shide is actually the name of a monastic community established in the vicinity of the <a href=""/geographies/view/Lhasa-Tsuklakhang/TBRC_G4261"">Lhasa Tsuklakhang</a> during the time of <a href=""/biographies/view/King-Relpachen/TBRC_P2MS13218"">King Relpachen</a>. The Shide monastic community shifted locations over the centuries. In the thirteenth century, the Tsel Gungtang rulers of Lhasa appointed the Shide monastic community as the caretakers of <a href=""/geographies/view/Ramoche-Temple/TBRC_G4552"">Ramoche Temple</a>, which duty they performed until 1862 when the Reting regent was disgraced. Shide was reestablished in its present location in Lhasa in the mid eighteenth century under the <a href=""/biographies/view/Seventh-Dalai-Lama/TBRC_P179"">Seventh Dalai Lama</a>. When the <a href=""/biographies/view/Third-Reting/TBRC_P191"">Third Reting</a> became regent in 1845, he restored the monastery which became his seat in Lhasa. (His primary seat was <a href=""/geographies/view/Reting-Monastery/TBRC_G74"">Reting Monastery</a>.) The <a href=""/incarnation/view/Reting-tulkus/TBRC_R8LS12816"">Reting tulkus</a> were one of only a few high-ranking incarnation lines empowered to become regent of Tibet during the absence or minority of the Dalai Lamas. As such, Shide was one of only five regency seats in Lhasa.</p>
<p>
	After 1959 Shide Dratsang was closed, and its contents taken away. After 1966, as the Cultural Revolution began, the main temple was vandalized and, left to the elements, it collapsed in 1989. In 2003, restoration work began at Shide.&nbsp;</p>

902,NULL,Shatra,"<p>
	The Shatra manor house, located south of the Jokhang, was built in the nineteenth century by Shatra Dondrub Dorje. It was home to the Shatra aristocratic family, whose members included <a href=""/biographies/view/Prime-Minister-Lochen-Shatra-Peljor-Dorje/TBRC_P6694"">Prime Minister Lochen Shatra Peljor Dorje</a> (1860-1919). The family was active in Lhasa as early as the fifteenth century. The house itself is one of the finest preserved, if not the finest, mansions in Lhasa and contains all of the major features of the traditional Tibetan residential building. In 2010, residents were evicted so the property could be developed into a hotel.&nbsp;</p>
"
903,G1TD44,Tromsikhang,"<p>
	The Tromsikhang mansion, a three-story stone building with courtyard structure located on the northern side of Barkor, was built as a residence for the <a href=""/biographies/view/Sixth-Dalai-Lama/TBRC_P352"">Sixth Dalai Lama</a> around the late seventeenth century and used as residence by Mongol ruler <a href=""/biographies/view/Lhazang-Khan/TBRC_P420"">Lhazang Khan</a> until his death in 1717. Qing Ambans also lived in the building at some point. The mansion was the site of many historic events, including the assasination of Gyurme Namgyel, the last lay ruler of Tibet. The aristocratic Changlochen family, who were descendents of Gyurme Namgyel, lived in the mansion, as did other minor aristocratic families over time. A police station was located in the building in the 1920&#39;s. The building was largely demolished in 1997, though the facade was restored and it received official &quot;protected&quot; status from the government around that time.</p>
"
904,NULL,Nangtseshar,"<p>
	Nangtseshar is known primarily as the prison and courthouse of Lhasa city (the Shol area at the base of the Potala had its own court and jail). Prior to its use as a court and prison in the eighteenth century, it was the seat and residence of a nobleman known as the Tolung Nangtse Depa. The large building contains many fine architectural details. It is located in the northern Barkhor area, next to the walls of the <a href=""/geographies/view/Jokhang/TBRC_G4261"">Jokhang</a>, although it does not have access points leading directly into the Jokhang. A dungeon was used to hold serious offenders, while an upper story held women and petty offenders. An outdoor staircase was the site of public executions. Scholar and artist <a href=""/biographies/view/Gendun-Chopel/TBRC_P219"">Gendun Chopel</a> was imprisoned in Nangtsehar in the 1940s.&nbsp;</p>
"
905,G222,Potala,"<p>
	The Potala Palace, named after the mountain home of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, looms high above the city of Lhasa on Marpori (red mountain) to the northwest of the <a href=""/geographies/view/Jokhang/TBRC_G4261"">Jokhang</a>. The current structure is thirteen stories tall, making it one of the world&#39;s tallest buildings to have pre-existed the modern skyscraper. &nbsp;It is considered a masterpiece that represents the pinnacle of classical Tibetan architectural style and highlights the ingenuity of the Palace&#39;s artisans and builders who were constrained by limited resources. It was designated a UNESCO world heritage site in 1994.</p>
<p>
	The existing palace is largely attributed to the <a href=""/biographies/view/Fifth-Dalai-Lama/TBRC_P37"">Fifth Dalai Lama</a>, who undertook an immense expansion of the original structure, which is dated to the year 637 during the reign of <a href=""/biographies/view/Songtsen-Gampo/TBRC_P8067"">Songtsen Gampo</a>. Some sources say that the original palace was eleven stories high, although it is possible it was considerably smaller. Several chapels, notably the Pakpa Lhakhang, are said to date from the time of Songsten Gampo. The Fifth Dalai Lama began building the White Palace upon the original foundation in 1645, with construction continuing until 1653. Thousands of workers and artisans hailing from near and far took part in the project. &nbsp;It would become the seat of the Ganden Podrang government (previously located at <a href=""/geographies/view/Drepung/TBRC_G108"">Drepung</a>), and the winter home of the Dalai Lamas (in summer, they resided at <a href=""/geographies/view/Norbulingka-Palace/TBRC_G4145"">Norbulingka Palace</a>). &nbsp;When the Fifth Dalai Lama passed away in 1682, his Regent, <a href=""/biographies/view/Desi-Sanggye-Gyatso/TBRC_P421"">Desi Sanggye Gyatso</a>, continued the expansion and completed the building of the Red Palace in 1694, all the while managing to cover-up the Dalai Lama&#39;s death. The structure is located at the center of the White Palace and extends several stories upward. It was used for religious purposes, containing many chapels and halls. Reliquaries for the Fifth Dalai Lama, and the <a href=""/biographies/view/Seventh/TBRC_P179"">Seventh</a> through twelfth&nbsp;Dalai Lamas are held in the Red Palace.</p>
<p>
	When Lhasa was attacked by the Dzungars in the early eighteenth century, the Potala was also damaged, and presumably many treasures went missing or were destroyed. Shelling during the Lhasa uprising in 1959 damaged the fa&ccedil;ade and once again works of art and texts were stolen and destroyed. Since that time, multiple phases of restoration have occurred. Today, the Potala functions as a museum; the influx of tourists presents challenges to ongoing conservation efforts. The Potala was surrounded by a walled neighborhood, the Shol, which was a center of administrative activity and included the <a href=""/geographies/view/Ngul-Parkhang/TBRC_TOL888"">Ngul Parkhang</a> (treasury), <a href=""/geographies/view/Makchikhang/TBRC_G1KT3"">Makchikhang</a> (armory), <a href=""/geographies/view/Zhol-Parkhang/TBRC_G1PD129185"">Shol Parkhang</a> (Shol printery), to name just a few.</p>
"
906,G4145,Norbulingkha,"<p>
	Located to the west of Lhasa, the Norbulingkha Palace was established during the time of the <a href=""/biographies/view/Seventh-Dalai-Lama/TBRC_P179"">Seventh Dalai Lama</a>, who selected the location based on natural springs onsite believed to benefit his health. Construction on the first building of the complex, Uyab Podrang, was completed around 1755. Over time, subsequent Dalai Lamas, who came to use Norbulingkha as summer residence (the Winter Palace was located in the <a href=""/geographies/view/Potala's/TBRC_G222"">Potala&#39;s</a> White Palace), commissioned additional buildings. Norbulingkha contains palace buildings, government buildings, and the opera grounds where outdoor performances are held.</p>
<p>
	In March of 1959, Norbulingka was an important site of resistance to Chinese occupation. Crowds of Tibetans surrounded the palace in an effort to guard the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who was inside the complex, having declined an invitation to attend a performance at the Chinese military camp. When the palace was subsequently shelled on March 17th, the Dalai Lama and a small party escaped to India through Lhoka, stopping at Lhuntse Dzong, where he repudiated the 17-Point Agreement.</p>
<p>
	Today, Norbulingkha, with its large gardens, fine buildings and art, outdoor performances and summer festivals, is a popular tourist site functioning as a museum. A significant rehabilitation effort began in 2003. It joined the Potala and <a href=""/geographies/view/Jokhang/TBRC_G4261"">Jokhang</a> as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001.</p>

This popularly held belief is unsupported by historical documentation; the complex was likely built between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, as it maintains archaic architectural details uncommon in later buildings. As such, it is one of the older functioning temples of Lhasa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	It is a two-story stone building that was partially turned into housing in 1966 and has undergone periods of restoration beginning in the 1980s.

For a time beginning in the 1960s, the building was given to the Tibetan Opera Troupe.
